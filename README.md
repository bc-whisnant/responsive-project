Treehouse Responsive Project

Fixed numerous errors before re-commiting.
They are as follows :

Fixed the additional div in html.
Added alt attributes to the img elements on page.
Validated that there are no hmtl issues by validating through https://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_input

Fixed the empty text-align element in css.
Added commas to the rgba value in css.
Fixed the grid layout issues by using nth-child inside media queries and outside.
Tested this extensively by giving the media queries background colors and resizing to see when it happened
to better be able to fix.
Validated that there were no issues with css through https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/#validate_by_input
  //The validation tools are a major help.
  
Exported a higher resolution image through sketch in an effort to improve the appearance of the profile picture.
Verified that the picture was a little larger also and checked to make sure it looks good on all screen sizes.

Tested site at http://bc-whisnant.github.io/responsive-project/ to make sure it works without issue.
